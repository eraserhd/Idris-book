## Pair with Me

Hi!  I'd like to remote pair with you on Idris code (or hacking on Idris
itself).  I make no promises about being super-competent -- I'm learning this
stuff too -- and have no requirements about your level of expertise, so long
as we both are collaborating on code.

For me, it would be just as fun to pair with Edwin Brady on Idris guts as it
would to pair with someone on getting "Hello, World!" working.

We could:

- Solve a toy problem
- Look at some ugly, baffling error
- Fix one of Idris' [low-hanging fruit](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22C-Low+Hanging+Fruit%22) issues

Visit [my appoint.ly](https://appoint.ly/s/eraserhd/idris) to schedule.

You can also find me as `eraserhd` on Twitter or in `#idris` on Freenode.
